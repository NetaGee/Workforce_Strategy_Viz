For those individuals who aren't able to afford college or additional debt, opportunities for a high paying job or career path are immediately limited. The majority of professional occupations require higher education, typically four years of tuition for a bachelor's degree. Increased access to higher education and technical training for lower-income families can bridge the gap, in turn resulting in increased community wealth and a larger skilled labor pool. 

With the increase in certified online education and bootcamp-style programs, local companies can widen the skilled labor force by investing in and providing access to education and resources.

Where there's a large metropolitan area with a diverse labor force, there's a Headquarters. Companies have a better chance of filling roles on time and expanding when both a skilled and unskilled labor force is available. However, some labor markets may become too competitive when there are multiple companies looking for the same type of labor. These companies may look to move into states that have lower competition while still appearing attractive for people to move to.

It's no surprise that housing is the largest expense for the average family. Housing is especially expensive in cities, which are attractive for businesses to set up shop in due to a large labor supply in close proximity. However, rent becomes increasingly expensive as more people continue to move into cities for jobs. In areas such as Silicon Valley, housing supply can't keep up with demand. Companies are forced to offer higher compensation to offset the increase in housing prices, and would do well to invest in affordable housing in the area or establish offices in cheaper locations to avoid increasing labor market competition in the long run.

Almost two-fifths of the population likely struggle to pay for higher education. Income has been associated with access to higher education due to the beneficial activities, resources, and other advantages that a higher income can provide throughout a child's life. Corporations and the wealthiest Americans can and should invest in expanding quality education across the nation. Curriculum design, with input from a variety of sources including companies and higher education institutions, should properly prepare youth to, among other things, contribute to a skilled workforce.

Companies in competitive labor markets are finding the available skilled labor supply to be smaller than they need. Requiring a bachelor's degree can limit the skilled labor supply since it excludes those who may not have been able to afford college or chose to start working after high school. Additionally, students may not realize the demand different industries have for certain fields of study before they have to declare one. Companies can do a better job of reaching out to their intended workforce years in advance through educational programs and opportunities. Additionally, companies can sponsor and encourage non-traditional learning through online degrees and bootcamps.

The gender pay gap has been around since the beginning of pay. It is no secret that women get paid less than a man for the same job. In 2019, we should no longer be deciding compensation based on gender and bias. It is important for every business to audit their wages for men and women. This is crucial for creating an attractive work environment that invests, appreciates, and retains the female labor force.

Studies have proven the benefits of hiring employees of diverse backgrounds and experiences. While this breakdown of occupation by race may show that employers still need to do a better job of seeking out and recruiting a diverse labor force, but it may also point to other factors associated with race that lead to low labor force participation. Some factors may be income and poverty, quality of education, access to resources, health availability, and incarceration.
