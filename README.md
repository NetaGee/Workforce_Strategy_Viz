# Workforce_Strategy_Viz

Viz_1 is the first series of 3 graphs. One is a dot graph that offers an overview of the USA Labor Market in 2018, the other a hexbin map representing the states by number of Fortune 500 company headquarters, and the last a line graph showing the different median rent prices for a one bedroom apartment in U.S. cities.
