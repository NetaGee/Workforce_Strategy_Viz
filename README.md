# Workforce_Strategy_Viz

Viz_1 is the first series of 3 graphs. One is a dot graph that offers an overview of the USA Labor Market in 2018, the other a hexbin map representing the states by number of Fortune 500 company headquarters, and the last a line graph showing the different median rent prices for a one bedroom apartment in U.S. cities. 

Viz_2 contains the first 3 graphs with updates, along with 2 additional graphs. One is a ribbon plot that details income inequality between the different fifths of the population and the top 5%. The other is a circular bar chart detailing the bachelor degree field of study by degrees confered in 2016.
